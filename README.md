## Introduction

This simulation is designed to represent a grid of cells, where each cell can contain various types of molecules or substances. The cells interact with each other based on predefined rules, and the simulation allows you to observe the behaviors of different cell types and molecules.

## Features

- Cellular automaton simulation with different cell types.
- Interaction between molecules and cells.
- Real-time visualization of the simulation using Pygame.
- User-friendly controls to modify the grid.

## Installation

To run this simulation on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/Ayvem/cellularSimulation.git
   ```
2. Install Python if you haven't already. You can download it from python.org.
3. Install the required libraries using pip:
   ```shell
   pip install pygame numpy
   ```
## Usage
To start the simulation, run the **game.py** file:
```shell
   python game.py
   ```
The simulation will open in a Pygame window, and you can interact with it using the controls described below.

## Controls
- Use the mouse scroll wheel to zoom in and out of the grid.
- Click and drag the mouse to move the grid.
- Press 'e' to select the previous cell type.
- Press 'r' to select the next cell type.
- Press 'a' to toggle between running and pausing the simulation.
- Press 'z' to display information about the molecules in a selected cell.
